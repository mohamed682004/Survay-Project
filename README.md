# 🧠 Survey Final Project: Small Neural Network Adventures

Welcome to my **final project** where I took a humble **251-rows survey** and decided it was a good idea to throw a **Small Neural Network (SNN)** at it.  
Is it overkill? Probably. Was it fun? **Absolutely!**

## Project Highlights

- 🏗️ Built an **SNN** to predict 3 different classes — yes, with **only 251 samples**.  
- 🎯 Took care of the **class imbalance** problem smartly:
  - Used **class weights** in the SNN training.
  - Applied **SMOTE** to synthesize more data.
- 🌲 For traditional models, a **Random Forest** (with SMOTE) gave the best estimates.
- 🤹‍♂️ Classes were *very* imbalanced, but hey — that's what makes machine learning fun, right?

## Models Tried

- Small Neural Network (SNN) with class weights
- SMOTE + Random Forest (best traditional performance!)

## Final Thoughts

Using a neural network for a tiny survey dataset might sound nuts — but hey, **if you're gonna overkill, do it with style.** 🚀  
Super happy with how this turned out for a final project! 🎉
